## Project definition

### Background

Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, or ADHD, is characterized by inattention, impulsivity and hyperactivity. Its prevalence in Argentina is 4% in children and adolescents. It is still diagnosed using subjective clinical criteria, which are often difficult to evaluate. However, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques hold potential for identifying neuroimaging biomarkers that could facilitate the diagnosis of ADHD. Our objective is to develop machine learning classification models to detect ADHD through the analysis of resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) signals.

### Tools

Our project used the following tools:

**Bash Terminal**: Employed for command-line operations and scripting.

**Git and GitHub**: Managed version control, shared workspace, and repositories.

**Jupyter Notebook**: Implemented the code within this interactive environment.

**Python**:
* Nilearn: to facilitate the processing and visualization of neuroimaging data.
* Matplotlib and Seaborn: for data visualization.
* Numpy and Pandas: for data manipulation and analysis.
* AAL atlas: For brain parcellation.


### Data

The ADHD-200 Sample is a collaborative effort involving eight international imaging sites that have openly shared neuroimaging data from 362 children and adolescents diagnosed with ADHD, along with 585 typically developing controls. This collection includes 947 datasets containing both structural and resting-state fMRI data, as well as phenotypic information from the subjects.

### Deliverables

At the end of this project, the following files will be made available:
* The current markdown document.
* Python scripts in a jupyter notebook.
* Figures of our results: Connectivity matrix, graphs for statistical analysis, visualizations
* A repository on GitHub to share our work and methods.

##### ECG pupilometry pipeline by Marce Kauffmann

The repository of this project can be found [here](https://github.com/mtl-brainhack-school-2019/ecg_pupillometry_pipeline_kaufmann). The objective was to create a processing pipeline for ECG and pupillometry data. The motivation behind this task is that Marcel's lab (MIST Lab @ Polytechnique Montreal) was conducting a Human-Robot-Interaction user study. The repo features:
 * a [video introduction](http://www.youtube.com/watch/8ZVCNeX42_A) to the project.
 * a presentation [made in a jupyter notebook](https://github.com/mtl-brainhack-school-2019/ecg_pupillometry_pipeline_kaufmann/blob/master/BrainHackPresentation.ipynb) on the results of the project.
 * Notebooks for all analyses.
 * Detailed requirements files, making it easy for others to replicate the environment of the notebook.
 * An overview of the results in the markdown document.
